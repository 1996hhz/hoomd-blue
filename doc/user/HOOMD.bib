abstract = {Molecular dynamics integrators are presented for translational and rotational motion of rigid molecules in microcanonical, canonical, and isothermal-isobaric ensembles. The integrators are all time reversible and are also, in some approaches, symplectic for the microcanonical ensembles. They are developed utilizing the quaternion representation on the basis of the Trotter factorization scheme using a Hamiltonian formalism. The structure is similar to that of the velocity Verlet algorithm. Comparison is made with standard integrators in terms of stability and it is found that a larger time step is stable with the new integrators. The canonical and isothermal-isobaric molecular dynamics simulations are defined by using a chain thermostat approach according to generalized Nos\'{e}-Hoover and Andersen methods.},

@article{Phillips2011,
abstract = {Brownian Dynamics (BD), also known as Langevin Dynamics, and Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) are implicit solvent methods commonly used in models of soft matter and biomolecular systems. The interaction of the numerous solvent particles with larger particles is coarse-grained as a Langevin thermostat is applied to individual particles or to particle pairs. The Langevin thermostat requires a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) to generate the stochastic force applied to each particle or pair of neighboring particles during each time step in the integration of Newton’s equations of motion. In a Single-Instruction-Multiple-Thread (SIMT) GPU parallel computing environment, small batches of random numbers must be generated over thousands of threads and millions of kernel calls. In this communication we introduce a one-PRNG-per-kernel-call-per-thread scheme, in which a micro-stream of pseudorandom numbers is generated in each thread and kernel call. These high quality, statistically robust micro-streams require no global memory for state storage, are more computationally efficient than other PRNG schemes in memory-bound kernels, and uniquely enable the DPD simulation method without requiring communication between threads.},

@article{Nguyen2011,
abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) methods compute the trajectory of a system of point particles in response to a potential function by numerically integrating Newtonʼs equations of motion. Extending these basic methods with rigid body constraints enables composite particles with complex shapes such as anisotropic nanoparticles, grains, molecules, and rigid proteins to be modeled. Rigid body constraints are added to the GPU-accelerated MD package, HOOMD-blue, version 0.10.0. The software can now simulate systems of particles, rigid bodies, or mixed systems in microcanonical (NVE), canonical (NVT), and isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensembles. It can also apply the FIRE energy minimization technique to these systems. In this paper, we detail the massively parallel scheme that implements these algorithms and discuss how our design is tuned for the maximum possible performance. Two different case studies are included to demonstrate the performance attained, patchy spheres and tethered nanorods. In typical cases, HOOMD-blue on a single GTX 480 executes 2.5–3.6 times faster than LAMMPS executing the same simulation on any number of CPU cores in parallel. Simulations with rigid bodies may now be run with larger systems and for longer time scales on a single workstation than was previously even possible on large clusters.},
