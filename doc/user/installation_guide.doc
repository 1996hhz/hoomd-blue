\section sec_system_req System requirements
 - \b OS: 
    - Supported Linux distributions - \b Recommended
        - Ubuntu 9.04 - 64-bit
        - Fedora 10 - 64-bit
        - Gentoo - 64-bit
        - RHEL/CentOS 5.4 - 64-bit
    - Mac OS X
        - 10.5.x Leopard
    - Windows
        - XP
        - Vista
        - <i>Note:</i> Windows builds are not tested and validated for <i>long running</i> simulations, and are provided
        only as a convenience for users to test and benchmark HOOMD-blue. Linux is the primary platform for hoomd.
 - \b CPU: Any x86_64 processor
 - \b RAM: At least as much system RAM as there is video memory total on all GPUs. For example, a host with four 4GB
           Tesla GPUs connected to it should have at least 16 GB of RAM.
 - \b GPU: A <a href=" http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home.html">CUDA capable GPU</a> is required to run hoomd with
    GPU acceleration. HOOMD-blue 0.9.0 will \em execute on any CUDA capable GPU, but only the current and previous
    generation GPUs at the time of release are fully supported by the developers. Download and run an older version of
    hoomd if you need support for older GPUs. Continue reading for a full list of GPUs supported by HOOMD-blue 0.9.x.

\section sec_gpu_options Supported GPUs

A GPU is needed to take full advantage of hoomd's performance capabilities. 
See http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/benchmarks.html for representative performance numbers.

There are a number of ways to configure a computer system with GPUs.

<h2>Workstation solutions</h2>

<h3>Upgrade an existing desktop system</h3>
If a desktop computer meets the necessary system requirements, a GPU can be added to it. Neither this document nor the
hoomd developers can determine if your system meets those requirements. Consult an IT professional for advice, if
needed. The manufacturer's product page should list the requirements for a particular GPU. One word of caution:
pre-built systems from many vendors are often engineered with very little extra space or power, and fast GPUs which are
both large and power-hungry will either not fit or fail to operate. A self-powered 
<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_quadroplex_2200_d2_us.html">Quadro Plex 2200 D2</a> might be an option
for a desktop with such limitations, but it may also be less expensive to simply buy a new desktop equipped with GeForce
GPUs.

For GPU-ready desktops, there are many GPUs that are supported by HOOMD-blue 0.9.x.

The following are consumer level GPUs marketed for gaming.
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_geforce_gtx_480_us.html">GeForce GTX 480</a> - \b Recommended
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_geforce_gtx_470_us.html">GeForce GTX 470</a>
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_geforce_gtx_295_us.html">GeForce GTX 295</a>

- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_geforce_210_us.html">GeForce GT 210</a>
- \b Note: Factory-overclocked models are \b not supported.

Tesla CXXXX GPUs are professional level compute cards with more memory than their consumer-level counterparts.
Also, Tesla C20X0 cards are capable of four times more double precision FLOPS than GTX 480.
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_tesla_C2050_C2070_us.html">Tesla C2070</a>

Quadro GPUs are professional level graphics workstation cards.

- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_quadro_fx_380lp_us.html">Quadro FX 380 LP</a>

<h3>Purchase a new workstation</h3>
Pre-built workstations can be purchased from a number of vendors with any of the above GeForce and Quadro GPUs. Be sure
to check out vendors that offer custom gaming rigs. Some offer high performance configurations with up to 3 GPUs.

A limited set of vendors sell workstations with Tesla GPUs pre-installed: see http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla_wtb.html

A custom-built workstation is also an option for \em expert system builders and IT professionals.
NVIDIA has published a set of recommendations as a starting point: http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla_build_your_own.html

<h2>Data center installations</h2>

Data centers demand rack mount hardware. There are several GPU computing systems supported by HOOMD. These are 1U
rack mount enclosures containing 4 GPUs, a power supply and cooling fans. Two PCIe interface cards connect the GPU computing
system to one or two host nodes.
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_tesla_S2050_S2070_us.html">Tesla S2070</a>
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_tesla_S2050_S2070_us.html">Tesla S2050</a> - \b Recommended
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_tesla_s1070_us.html">Tesla S1070</a>

A number of rack mount host node configurations also accept Tesla MXXX cards.
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_tesla_M2050_M2070_us.html">Tesla M2070</a>
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_tesla_M2050_M2070_us.html">Tesla M2050</a> - \b Recommended
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_tesla_m1060_us.html">Tesla M1060</a>

Quadro GPUs are also available in rack mount configurations. They are marketed and built more for high performance
visualization systems, but are supported by HOOMD-blue.
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_quadroplex_2200_d2_us.html">Quadro Plex 2200 D2</a>
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_quadroplex_2200_s4_us.html">Quadro Plex 2200 S4</a>

See http://www.nvidia.com/object/preconfigured_clusters.html for even more data center options.

<h2>Laptops</h2>

There are many laptop GPUs capable of running hoomd. Due to power, heat, and stability concerns, the hoomd developers
will not support laptops as a platform for long running hoomd simulations.

<h2>Future GPUs</h2>
GPUs newer than this document may also be supported. HOOMD-blue 0.9.x is tested and supported on the Fermi (GF100)
and Tesla (G200) generations. All GPUs from these generations, even ones not in existence at release time, are
supported.

 -# <b>Download</b> the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit appropriate for your system from http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html . 
    <br><b>To install</b>, open a terminal, cd to the directory where you downloaded the file and then run
    \code
 sudo bash cudatoolkit_*.run
    \endcode
    Follow the on screen prompts to complete the installation. After installation, you need to place
    the installed directories on your path. <b>Open</b> your ~/.bashrc file and add these lines to the end:
    \code
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/lib
export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/cuda/bin
\endcode
    You will probably need to log out and back in for the path setting to take effect.

 -# (if you have an NVIDIA GPU) <b>Download</b> the latest drivers for your GPU from http://www.nvidia.com . 
    <br><b>To install</b>, open a terminal, cd to the directory where you downloaded the file and then run
    \code
sudo bash NVIDIA-Linux-*.run
    \endcode
    Follow the on screen prompts to complete the installation.
    <br><br>
 -# Before you download HOOMD-blue, check which python version you have by running 
 	\code
 python -V
 	\endcode
 	in a terminal.
    <br><br>
 -# <b>Download</b> the matching HOOMD-blue package from http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/download.html
    <br><b>To install</b> to your <i>home directory</i>, open a terminal, cd to the directory where you downloaded the file
    and then run
 	\code
 tar -xvjpf hoomd-0.9.0-*.tar.bz2 -C ~/
 	\endcode
 	in a terminal. To <i>instead</i> install in a system directory for all users to access, extract into /opt by running
  	\code
 sudo tar -xvjpf hoomd-0.9.0-*.tar.bz2 -C /opt
    \endcode
    <b>Open</b> your ~/.bashrc file and add this line to the end:

    You will probably need to log out and back in for the path setting to take effect.

\b Note: When upgrading to a new version of HOOMD-blue, update the lines you have already added to ~/.bashrc 
instead of adding new ones.

The standard benchmark scripts serve as a <b>good test</b> of your installation. To <b>run one of them</b>, open a
terminal and run:
\code
 cd ~/hoomd-0.9.0-Linux-x86_64-Python2.5/share/hoomd/benchmarks
 hoomd lj_liquid_bmark.hoomd
 # ... watch the simulation run ...
