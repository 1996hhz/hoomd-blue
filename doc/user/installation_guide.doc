\section sec_system_req System requirements
 - \b OS: 
    - Supported Linux distributions
        - Ubuntu 9.04 - 64-bit
        - Fedora 10 - 64-bit
        - Gentoo - 64-bit
        - RHEL/CentOS 5.3 - 64-bit
    - Mac OS X
        - 10.5.x Leopard
    - Windows 
        - XP
        - Vista
        - <i>Note:</i> Windows builds are not tested for long running simulations, and are provided as a convenience
        for users to test and benchmark HOOMD-blue. Linux is the must supported and most stable platform for production
        runs.
 - \b CPU: Any x86_64 processor
 - \b RAM: At least as much system RAM as there is video memory total on all GPUs. For example, a host with four 4GB
           Tesla GPUs connected to it should have at least 16 GB of RAM.
 - \b GPU: Any CUDA capable card: http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home.html (see \ref sec_gpu_options).

\section sec_gpu_options Supported GPUs

A GPU is needed to take full advantage of hoomd's performance capabilities. 
See http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/benchmarks.html for representative performance numbers.

There are a number of ways to configure a computer system with GPUs.

<h2>Workstation solutions</h2>

<h3>Upgrade an existing desktop system</h3>
If a desktop computer meets the necessary system requirements, a GPU can be added to it. Neither this document nor the
hoomd developers can determine if your system meets those requirements. Consult an IT professional for advice, if
needed. The manufacturer's product page should list the requirements for a particular GPU. One word of caution:
pre-built systems from many vendors are often engineered with very little extra space or power, and fast GPUs which are
both large and power-hungry will either not fit or fail to operate.

For GPU-ready desktops, there are many GPUs that are supported by HOOMD-blue 0.9.x.

The following are consumer level GPUs marketed for gaming.
- GeForce GTX 480
- GeForce GTX 470
- GeForce GTX 295
- GeForce GTX 285
- GeForce GTX 275
- GeForce GTX 260
- GeForce GT 240
- GeForce GT 210
- \b Note: Factory-overclocked models are not supported.

Tesla CXXXX GPUs are professional level compute cards with more memory than their consumer-level counterparts.
Also, Tesla C20X0 cards are capable of four times more double precision FLOPS than GTX 480.
- Tesla C2070
- Tesla C2050
- Tesla C1060

Quadro GPUs are professional level graphics workstation cards.
- Quadro FX 5800
- Quadro FX 4800
- Quadro FX 380 LP

<h3>Purchase a new workstation</h3>
Pre-built workstations can be purchased from a number of vendors with any of the above GeForce and Quadro GPUs.
A limited set of vendors sell workstations with Tesla GPUs preinstalled: see http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla_wtb.html

A custom-built workstation is also an option for \em expert system builders and IT professionals.
NVIDIA has published a set of recommendations as a starting point: http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla_build_your_own.html

<h2>Data center installations</h2>

Data centers demand rack-mount hardware. There are several GPU computing systems supported by HOOMD. These are 1U
rackmount enclosures containing 4 GPUs, a power supply and cooling fans. Two PCIe interface cards connect the GPU computing
system to one or two host nodes.
- Tesla S2070
- Tesla S2050
- Tesla S1070

A number of rack-mount host node configurations also accept Tesla MXXX cards. These are also supported by HOOMD-blue.
- Tesla M1060

See http://www.nvidia.com/object/preconfigured_clusters.html for more data center options.

<h2>Laptops</h2>

There are many laptop GPUs capable of running hoomd. Due to power, heat, and stability concerns, the hoomd developers
cannot support long running simulations on laptop GPUs.

<h2>Others</h2>
GPUs newer than this document may also be supported. HOOMD-blue 0.9.x is tested and supported on the Fermi (GF100)
and Tesla (G200) generations (except GTX 280).

\section sec_install_hoomd_windows Installing HOOMD-blue in Windows

 -# Download the HOOMD-blue installer from http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/download.html
 -# Install Python 2.6.x using the installer at http://www.python.org/download/
 -# Install the latest drivers for your GPU from http://www.nvidia.com (if you have an NVIDIA card)
 -# Uninstall any previous version of HOOMD/HOOMD-blue before continuing
 -# Double click on the HOOMD-blue installer and follow the on screen steps
 
HOOMD-blue should now show up on your <b>Start menu</b> and the \a .hoomd file type 
is registered to execute the script when you double-click on one.
The command \b hoomd can also be run on the <b>command line</b> to start the HOOMD-blue python interpreter.

Standard benchmarks are included. They can be run by selecting them from the start menu.

Check out the \ref page_quick_start to start learning how to use hoomd.

\section sec_install_hoomd_linux Installing HOOMD-blue in Linux

 -# <b>Download</b> the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit appropriate for your system from http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html . 
    <br><b>To install</b>, open a terminal, cd to the directory where you downloaded the file and then run
    \code
 sudo bash cudatoolkit_*.run
    \endcode
    Follow the on screen prompts to complete the installation. After installation, you need to place
    the installed directories on your path. <b>Open</b> your ~/.bashrc file and add these lines to the end:
    \code
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/lib
export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/cuda/bin
\endcode
    You will probably need to log out and back in for the path setting to take effect.
    <br><br>
 -# (if you have an NVIDIA GPU) <b>Download</b> the latest drivers for your GPU from http://www.nvidia.com . 
    <br><b>To install</b>, open a terminal, cd to the directory where you downloaded the file and then run
    \code
sudo bash NVIDIA-Linux-*.run
    \endcode
    Follow the on screen prompts to complete the installation.
    <br><br>
 -# Before you download HOOMD-blue, check which python version you have by running 
 	\code
 python -V
 	\endcode
 	in a terminal.
    <br><br>
 -# <b>Download</b> the matching HOOMD-blue package from http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/download.html
    <br><b>To install</b> to your <i>home directory</i>, open a terminal, cd to the directory where you downloaded the file
    and then run
 	\code
 tar -xvjpf hoomd-0.8.2-*.tar.bz2 -C ~/
 	\endcode
 	in a terminal. To <i>instead</i> install in a system directory for all users to access, extract into /opt by running
  	\code
 sudo tar -xvjpf hoomd-0.8.2-*.tar.bz2 -C /opt
    \endcode
    <b>Open</b> your ~/.bashrc file and add this line to the end:
    \code
 export PATH=${PATH}:${HOME}/hoomd-0.8.2-Linux-x86_64-Python2.5/bin
    \endcode
    <i>Adjust</i> the name of the directory to <b>match the one you installed</b>.
    You will probably need to log out and back in for the path setting to take effect.

\b Note: When upgrading to a new version of HOOMD-blue, update the lines you have already added to ~/.bashrc 
instead of adding new ones.

The standard benchmark scripts serve as a <b>good test</b> of your installation. To <b>run one of them</b>, open a
terminal and run:
\code
 cd ~/hoomd-0.8.2-Linux-x86_64-Python2.5/share/hoomd/benchmarks
 hoomd lj_liquid_bmark.hoomd
 # ... watch the simulation run ...
\endcode
As before, <i>adjust</i> the name of the directory to <b>match the one you installed</b>. Run ls to see a list
of other benchmarks you can run.
