\section sec_system_req System requirements
 - \b OS: 
    - Supported Linux distributions - \b Recommended
        - Ubuntu 10.04
        - Fedora 13
        - Gentoo
        - RHEL/CentOS 5.5
    - Mac OS X
        - 10.6.x Snow Leopard
 - \b CPU: Any x86_64 processor
 - \b RAM: At least as much system RAM as there is video memory total on all GPUs. For example, a host with four 4GB
           Tesla GPUs connected to it should have at least 16 GB of RAM.
 - \b GPU: (optional) A <a href=" http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home.html">CUDA capable GPU</a> is required to run hoomd with
    GPU acceleration. Without one, hoomd will run on the CPU.
 - \b Software:
   - Linux
     - (if you have an NVIDIA GPU) NVIDIA Drivers version 260.19.26 or newer (http://www.nvidia.com)
     - All other required software will be installed via package dependances
   - Mac OS X
     - (if you have an NVIDIA GPU) NVIDIA Developer Drivers version 3.2 or newer ( http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html#MacOS )
       <br>Note that once installed, the developer drivers can be updated via the CUDA panel in System Preferences.
     - All other required software is included in the application bundle.
     
VMD 1.9 or newer (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) is not a requirement to run HOOMD-blue, but you may find it
extremely useful in visualizing simulation results. VMD 1.9 includes native support for reading HOOMD-blue XML files.

\section sec_gpu_options Supported GPUs

A GPU is needed to take full advantage of hoomd's performance capabilities. 
See http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/benchmarks.html for representative performance numbers.

There are a number of ways to configure a computer system with GPUs.

<h2>Workstation solutions</h2>

<h3>Upgrade an existing desktop system</h3>
If a desktop computer meets the necessary system requirements, a GPU can be added to it. Neither this document nor the
hoomd developers can determine if your system meets those requirements. Consult an IT professional for advice, if
needed. The manufacturer's product page should list the requirements for a particular GPU. One word of caution:
pre-built systems from many vendors are often engineered with very little extra space or power, and fast GPUs which are
both large and power-hungry will either not fit or fail to operate. A self-powered 
<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_quadroplex_2200_d2_us.html">Quadro Plex 2200 D2</a> might be an option
for a desktop with such limitations, but it may also be less expensive to simply buy a new desktop equipped with GeForce
GPUs.

For GPU-ready desktops, there are many GPUs that are supported by HOOMD-blue 0.9.x.

The following are consumer level GPUs marketed for gaming.
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product-geforce-gtx-580-us.html">GeForce GTX 580</a> - \b Recommended for performance desktops

<h3>Purchase a new workstation</h3>
Pre-built workstations can be purchased from a number of vendors with any of the above GeForce and Quadro GPUs. Be sure
to check out vendors that offer custom gaming rigs. Some offer high performance configurations with up to 3 GPUs.

A limited set of vendors sells workstations with Tesla GPUs pre-installed: see http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla_wtb.html

A custom-built workstation is also an option for \em expert system builders and IT professionals.
NVIDIA has published a set of recommendations as a starting point: http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla_build_your_own.html

<h2>Data center installations</h2>

Data centers demand rack mount hardware. There are several GPU computing systems supported by HOOMD. These are 1U
rack mount enclosures containing 4 GPUs, a power supply and cooling fans. Two PCIe interface cards connect the GPU computing
system to one or two host nodes.
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product-tesla-S2050-us.html">Tesla S2050</a> - \b Recommended
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_tesla_s1070_us.html">Tesla S1070</a>

A number of rack mount enclosures and host nodes also accept Tesla MXXX cards.
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_tesla_M2050_M2070_us.html">Tesla M2070</a>
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_tesla_M2050_M2070_us.html">Tesla M2050</a> - \b Recommended
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_tesla_m1060_us.html">Tesla M1060</a>

Quadro GPUs are also available in rack mount configurations. They are marketed and built more for high performance
visualization systems, but are supported by HOOMD-blue.
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_quadroplex_2200_d2_us.html">Quadro Plex 2200 D2</a>
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_quadroplex_2200_s4_us.html">Quadro Plex 2200 S4</a>

See http://www.nvidia.com/object/preconfigured_clusters.html for even more data center options.

<h2>Laptops</h2>

There are many laptop GPUs capable of running hoomd. Due to power, heat, and stability concerns, the hoomd developers
do not support laptops as a platform for long running hoomd simulations.

<h2>Future GPUs</h2>
GPUs newer than this document may also be supported. HOOMD-blue 0.9.x is tested and supported on the Fermi (GF100)
and Tesla (G200) generations. All GPUs from these generations are supported.

\section sec_install_hoomd_linux Installing HOOMD-blue in Linux

 -# <b>Download</b> the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit appropriate for your system from http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html . 
    <br><b>To install</b>, open a terminal, cd to the directory where you downloaded the file and then run
    \code
 sudo bash cudatoolkit_*.run
    \endcode
    Follow the on screen prompts to complete the installation. After installation, you need to place
    the installed directories on your path. <b>Open</b> your ~/.bashrc file and add these lines to the end:
    \code
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/lib
export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/cuda/bin
\endcode
    You will probably need to log out and back in for the path setting to take effect.
    <br><br>
 -# (if you have an NVIDIA GPU) <b>Download</b> the latest drivers for your GPU from http://www.nvidia.com . 
    <br><b>To install</b>, open a terminal, cd to the directory where you downloaded the file and then run
    \code
sudo bash NVIDIA-Linux-*.run
    \endcode
    Follow the on screen prompts to complete the installation.
    <br><br>
 -# Before you download HOOMD-blue, check which python version you have by running 
 	\code
 python -V
 	\endcode
 	in a terminal.
    <br><br>
 -# <b>Download</b> the matching HOOMD-blue package from http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/download.html
    <br><b>To install</b> to your <i>home directory</i>, open a terminal, cd to the directory where you downloaded the file
    and then run
 	\code
 tar -xvjpf hoomd-0.9.0-*.tar.bz2 -C ~/
 	\endcode
 	in a terminal. To <i>instead</i> install in a system directory for all users to access, extract into /opt by running
  	\code
 sudo tar -xvjpf hoomd-0.9.0-*.tar.bz2 -C /opt

    <i>Adjust</i> the name of the directory to <b>match the one you installed</b>.
    You will probably need to log out and back in for the path setting to take effect.

\b Note: When upgrading to a new version of HOOMD-blue, update the lines you have already added to ~/.bashrc 
instead of adding new ones.

The standard benchmark scripts serve as a <b>good test</b> of your installation. To <b>run one of them</b>, open a
