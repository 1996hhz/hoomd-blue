\section sec_system_req System Requirements (to run on a GPU)
 - \b OS: Linux, Mac OS X, Windows Vista, or Windows XP
 - \b CPU: Any x86 or x86_64 processor
 - \b RAM: At least 1GB is recommended
 - \b GPU: Any CUDA capable card: http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home.html
 	- \b Recommended (listed here in the rough order of performance expected, see http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/benchmarks.html for actual performance numbers): 
		- GTX 285/295 (fastest)
		- GTX 280
		- Tesla 10 series
		- GTX 275
		- GTX 260
		- GTS 250
		
 - \b Motherboard: 16x PCIe slot for the graphics card. 
 - \b Power supply: Check with the GPU manufacturer for the power supply requirements for your GPU.
 	If you have a store-bought desktop system, its power supply is likely inadequate and will require upgrading.

\section sec_install_hoomd_windows Installing HOOMD-blue in Windows

 -# Download the HOOMD-blue installer from http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/download.html
 -# Install Python 2.6.x using the installer at http://www.python.org/download/
 -# Install the latest drivers for your GPU from http://www.nvidia.com (if you have an NVIDIA card)
 -# Uninstall any previous version of HOOMD/HOOMD-blue before continuing
 -# Double click on the HOOMD-blue installer and follow the on screen steps
 
HOOMD-blue should now show up on your <b>Start menu</b> and the \a .hoomd file type 
is registered to execute the script when you double-click on one.
The command \b hoomd can also be run on the <b>command line</b> to start the HOOMD-blue python interpreter.

Standard benchmarks are included. They can be run by selecting them from the start menu.

Check out the \ref page_quick_start to start learning how to use hoomd.

\section sec_install_hoomd_linux Installing HOOMD-blue in Linux

 -# <b>Download</b> the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit appropriate for your system from http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html . 
    <br><b>To install</b>, open a terminal, cd to the directory where you downloaded the file and then run
    \code
 sudo bash cudatoolkit_*.run
    \endcode
    Follow the on screen prompts to complete the installation. After installation, you need to place
    the installed directories on your path. <b>Open</b> your ~/.bashrc file and add these lines to the end:
    \code
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/lib
export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/cuda/bin
\endcode
    You will probably need to log out and back in for the path setting to take effect.
    <br><br>
 -# (if you have an NVIDIA GPU) <b>Download</b> the latest drivers for your GPU from http://www.nvidia.com . 
    <br><b>To install</b>, open a terminal, cd to the directory where you downloaded the file and then run
    \code
sudo bash NVIDIA-Linux-*.run
    \endcode
    Follow the on screen prompts to complete the installation.
    <br><br>
 -# Before you download HOOMD-blue, check which python version you have by running 
 	\code
 python -V
 	\endcode
 	in a terminal.
    <br><br>
 -# <b>Download</b> the matching HOOMD-blue package from http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/download.html
    <br><b>To install</b> to your <i>home directory</i>, open a terminal, cd to the directory where you downloaded the file
    and then run
 	\code
 tar -xvjpf hoomd-0.8.2-*.tar.bz2 -C ~/
 	\endcode
 	in a terminal. To <i>instead</i> install in a system directory for all users to access, extract into /opt by running
  	\code
 sudo tar -xvjpf hoomd-0.8.2-*.tar.bz2 -C /opt
    \endcode
    <b>Open</b> your ~/.bashrc file and add this line to the end:
    \code
 export PATH=${PATH}:${HOME}/hoomd-0.8.2-Linux-x86_64-Python2.5/bin
    \endcode
    <i>Adjust</i> the name of the directory to <b>match the one you installed</b>.
    You will probably need to log out and back in for the path setting to take effect.

\b Note: When upgrading to a new version of HOOMD-blue, update the lines you have already added to ~/.bashrc 
instead of adding new ones.

The standard benchmark scripts serve as a <b>good test</b> of your installation. To <b>run one of them</b>, open a
terminal and run:
\code
 cd ~/hoomd-0.8.2-Linux-x86_64-Python2.5/share/hoomd/benchmarks
 hoomd lj_liquid_bmark.hoomd
 # ... watch the simulation run ...
\endcode
As before, <i>adjust</i> the name of the directory to <b>match the one you installed</b>. Run ls to see a list
of other benchmarks you can run.
