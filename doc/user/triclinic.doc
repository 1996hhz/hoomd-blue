\section sec_triclinic_intro Introduction
HOOMD-blue fully supports triclinic simulation boxes. A triclinic box has six
varibles: the lengths \f$L_x\f$, \f$L_y\f$ and \f$L_z\f$ of the edges of the box, and
three tilt factors \f$xy\f$, \f$xz\f$ and \f$yz\f$.

If the cell parameter matrix \f$\mathbf{h}\f$ is defined in terms of the lattice vectors
\f$ a_1 \f$, \f$ a_2 \f$ and
\f$ a_3 \f$,i.e.
\f[ \mathbf{h} \equiv \left( \vec a_1, \vec a_2, \vec a_3 \right), \f]
by convention, the first lattice vector
\f$ a_1 \f$ is parallel to the unit vector \f$ \vec e_x = (1,0,0) \f$. The tilt factor
*xy* indicates how the second lattice vector \f$a_2\f$ is tilted with respect to the first one,
i.e. many units along the x-direction correspond to one unit of the second lattice
vector. Similarly, *xz* and *yz* indicate the tilt of the third lattice vector \f$ a_3 \f$
with respect to the first and second lattice vector.

\section sec_triclinic_definition Definitions and formulas for the cell parameter matrix
The full cell parameter matrix is 
\f{eqnarray*}{
\mathbf{h}& =& \left(\begin{array}{ccc} L_x & xy L_y & xz L_z \\
                                        0   & L_y    & yz L_z \\
                                        0   & 0      & L_z    \\
                     \end{array}\right)
\f}

Note, that *xy*, *xz* and *yz* are dimensionless.
The relationship between the tilt factors and the box angles \f$ \alpha \f$,
\f$ \beta \f$ and \f$ \gamma \f$ is as follows:
\f{eqnarray*}{
\cos\gamma \equiv \cos(\angle\vec a_1, \vec a_2) &=& \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1+xy^2}}\\
\cos\beta \equiv \cos(\angle\vec a_1, \vec a_3) &=& \frac{xz}{\sqrt{1+xz^2+yz^2}}\\
\cos\alpha \equiv \cos(\angle\vec a_2, \vec a_3) &=& \frac{xy*xz + yz}{\sqrt{1+xy^2} \sqrt{1+xz^2+yz^2}} \\
\f}

\section sec_triclinic_specify Specifying a triclinic simulation box
The preferred way to specify a triclinic simulation box is to do this in an
\link page_xml_file_format XML file\endlink.
A second way to specify the simulation box is to pass
a \b BoxDim argument to the constructor of
\link hoomd_script.init.create_random_polymers init.create_random_polymers\endlink,
as in
\code
init.create_random_polymers(box=hoomd.BoxDim(18, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3),
                            polymeres=[polymer2],
                            separation=dict(A=0.35, B=0.35));
\endcode
This creates a triclinic box with edges of length 18, and tilt factors
*xy*=0.1, *xz*=0.2 and *yz*=0.3.

\section sec_triclinic_update Updating the simulation box during the simulation
The triclinic unit cell can be updated in various ways. 

\subsection triclinic_resize Resizing the box
The simplest way is to use \link hoomd_script.update.box_resize update.box_resize \endlink.

To update the tilt factors continously during the simulation (shearing
the simulation box with \b Lees-Edwards boundary conditions), use:
\code
update.box_resize(xy = variant.linear_interp([(0,0), (1e6, 1)]))
\endcode
This command applies shear in the *xy*-plane so that the angle between the *x*-
and *y*-directions changes continously from 0 to 45\f$^\circ\f$ during 10^6 time steps.

\subsection triclinic_npt NPT or NPH integration
By integrating in a constant pressure ensemble,
the box is updated every time step, according to the
anisotropic stresses in the system. This is supported by

- \link hoomd_script.integrate.npt integrate.npt\endlink 
- \link hoomd_script.integrate.nph integrate.nph\endlink

Anisotropic constant-pressure integration modes for <b>rigid bodies</b>
are not yet available in HOOMD-blue, but the tilt factors and box lengths
can still be set to any arbitrary value and are
preserved during the course of the NPT or NPH integration.  This concerns

- \link hoomd_script.integrate.npt_rigid integrate.npt_rigid\endlink
- \link hoomd_script.integrate.nph_rigid integrate.nph_rigid\endlink

\subsection triclinic_other Other features
All other features of HOOMD-blue generally work with triclinic symmetry, including
\link page_mpi MPI\endlink simulations.

As for every rule, there is an exception.
- \link hoomd_script.dump.bin dump.bin\endlink (deprecated) has not been updated to work with triclinic
  boxes.
