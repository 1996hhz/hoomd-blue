//! Convex (Sphero)Polyhedron shape template
/*! ShapeSpheropolyhedron represents a convex polygon swept out by a sphere with special cases. A shape with zero
    vertices is a sphere centered at the particle location. This is degenerate with the one-vertex case and marginal
    more performant. As a consequence of the algorithm, two vertices with a sweep radius represents a prolate
    spherocylinder but not according to any standard convention and a simulation of spherocylinders using
    ShapeSpheropolyhedron will not perform as efficiently as a more specialized algorithm.

    The parameter defining a polyhedron is a structure containing a list of N vertices, centered on 0,0. In fact, it is
    **required** that the origin is inside the shape, and it is best if the origin is the center of mass.

    ShapeSpheropolygon interprets two additional fields in the verts struct that ShapeConvexPolyhedron lacks.
    The first is sweep_radius which defines the radius of the sphere to sweep around the polyong. The 2nd
    is ignore. When two shapes are checked for overlap, if both of them have ignore set to true (non-zero) then
    there is assumed to be no collision. This is intended for use with the penetrable hard-sphere model for depletants,
    but could be useful in other cases.
