To build a Redhat Package Manager package (RPM) of the current hoomd trunk,
copy the hoomd spec file in the SPECS directory to the SPECS directory in
your rpm build environment and run
rpmbuild -ba hoomd-0.9.1.spec

Make sure the nvcc compiler from the cuda toolkit is in your path.

For example:
$ cd <rpm build root>/SPECS
$ svn checkout http://codeblue.engin.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/svn/trunk/packaging/SPECS .
$ PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda/bin rpmbuild -ba hoomd-0.9.1.spec

Note that you will need cmake, subversion (svn), the rpm-build package (of
course), and some other software installed. Non-obvious missing software
should produce explicit error messages. If you have the software installed
but not as an rpm package, rpmbuild may still produce errors. To bypass
these errors, use 
$ rpmbuild -ba --nodeps hoomd-0.9.1.spec
