To build a Redhat Package Manager package (RPM) of the current hoomd trunk,
copy the hoomd spec file in this directory to the SPECS directory in your
rpm build environment and run
rpmbuild -ba hoomd-0.9.1.spec

Note that you will need cmake, subversion (svn), and some other software
installed. Non-obvious missing software should produce explicit error
messages. If you have the software installed but not as an rpm package,
rpmbuild may still produce errors. To bypass these errors, use 
rpmbuild -ba --nodeps hoomd-0.9.1.spec
