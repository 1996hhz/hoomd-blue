Welcome to the documentation for HOOMD! This includes both user and developer documentation,
and they are interlinked. So don't be alarmed if you are browsing the user-level documentation
for a particular command and follow a link only to find yourself at a page documenting
some internal c++ code. Just press the back button or click on "Main Page" at the top
if you get lost.

\page notes Some notes
This page is just a random location to put some notes

Assume fine-grained parallelism in the design for now. This concept may be expanded on at a later date, but it makes the design so much more elegant to keep it that way for now. This decision will be reevaluated after testing on multi-core machines.

boost::bind + a GPUWorker thread could be a VERY cool, slick, and elegant way to manage multiple GPUs. 

Should probably define which routines are thread safe and which are not. Even more so, which are safe by multiple readers, but not multiple writers

Make some eye-catching demos: One idea is to do something with "falling boxes" like the crysis movie or falling spheres like the demo in CUDA, have things crash into them and such. Another would be to make some cool ramp, run a box down it, then hit a see-saw or some such.  These can easily be done with springs at first, and then can be redone when rigid bodies are included.
