/*! \page page_system_guide Hardware/Software Requirements

Note: The CPU code in HOOMD is standards compliant C++ and should compile
on any architecture, contact the developers if you need HOOMD on a
different architecture. The rest of this document assumes you want to run
HOOMD on a GPU, thus limiting the options to those systems that
support CUDA http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home.html.

\section sec_hardware_req Hardware Requirements
 - \b CPU: Any x86 or x86_64 processor
 - \b RAM: At least 1GB is recommended, but HOOMD should run on systems with less.
 - \b GPU: Any CUDA capable card: http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home.html
 	- \b Recommended: Tesla, 8800 GTX, 8800 GTS 512MB, 8800 GT
 - \b Motherboard: 16x PCIe slot for the graphics card. If you are installing the card
 	in a second slot, double check you motherboard manual first. Many motherboards
 	will decrease the 2nd slot to 8x with 2 cards installed. While HOOMD will still
 	run in such a configuration, it is not recommended for performance reasons.
 	
\section sec_software_user_req Software Requirements
 - \b OS: Windows XP, Linux
 	- \b Note: Mac OS X support will be available once CUDA is released for it
 	- \b Note: Vista support will be available once CUDA is released for it
 - \b Python installed: http://www.python.org
 - \b CUDA toolkit 1.1 installed: http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home.html

\section sec_install_hoomd_windows Installing HOOMD in Windows XP

 -# Before you can install HOOMD, you must install both Python 2.5 and the
NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit 1.1. Both have self-extracting windows installers.<br>
http://www.python.org/download/
http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html#windows
 -# Download the HOOMD installer from http://www.ameslab.gov/hoomd
 -# Uninstall any previous version of HOOMD before continuing
 -# Double click on the installer and follow the on screen steps
 
HOOMD should now show up on your <b>Start menu</b> and the \a .hoomd file type 
is registered to execute the script when you double click on one.
The commands \b hoomd, \b force_compute_bmark, and \b neighborlist_compute_bmark
should also now bin in your PATH for execution from a <b>command line</b>.

The start menu includes links to benchmark scripts as well as several live demos.
In order to visualize the demos, you must have VMD 1.8.6 installed: http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/

\section sec_install_hoomd_linux Installing HOOMD in Linux

 -# Install the NVIDIA CUDA Toolket 1.1 : http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html#linux
 -# Before you download HOOMD, check which python version you have by running 
 	\code
 python -V
 	\endcode
 	in a terminal.
 -# Download the appropriate HOOMD package from http://www.ameslab.gov/hoomd
 -# Extract it using your favorite tool or by running
 	\code
 tar -xvjf hoomd-0.6.0-Linux-x86_64-Python2.4.tar.bz2
 	\endcode
 	in a terminal (modify the filename to match the one you downloaded of course).
 -# Lets say I extracted the file into the \a software directory in my home directory.
  	Then, ${EXTRACTED_LOCATION} would be /home/joaander/software/hoomd-0.6.0-Linux-x86_64
  	Below, replace ${EXTRACTED_LOCATION} with the location you extracted HOOMD to.
 -# Open ${EXTRACTED_LOCATION}/bin/hoomd in your favorite text editor. Find the line
  	starting with HOOMD_ROOT=
  \code
# modify the next line to list the full path where you extracted hoomd
HOOMD_ROOT= ... some path here ...
  \endcode
  Modify this line to read HOOMD_ROOT=${EXTRACTED_LOCATION} (replacing ${EXTRACTED_LOCATION} with the real directory name of course)
 -# Last step. Add ${EXTRACTED_LOCATION}/bin to your $PATH. 
  http://www.newlinuxuser.com/howto-add-a-directory-to-my-path-statementvariable/
  You will probably need to log out and back in for the path setting to take effect.

After installation is complete, you should be able to run 
\code
hoomd 
\endcode
in any terminal. You should see something like:
\code
Python 2.4.4 (#1, Nov  4 2007, 17:29:36)
[GCC 4.1.2 (Gentoo 4.1.2)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
\endcode
Wait a second. Python? This is correct behavior, though. HOOMD is really just a python
module. Job scripts are python scripts, and the hoomd executable is just a front end 
to python. As a user, you don't need to know how to write python code to use HOOMD.

For now, you can execute \b benchmarks and <b>live demos</b>. You will find them in ${EXTRACTED_LOCATION}/share/hoomd
For example, to run the polymer benchmark on the GPU:
\code
cd ${EXTRACTED_LOCATION}/share/hoomd/benchmarks/polymer
./polymer_bmark_gpu.hoomd
\endcode
You will also find \b force_compute_bmark and \b neighborlist_bmark in ${EXTRACTED_LOCATION}/share/hoomd/lib/hoomd .
These can be used to benchmark specific algorithms in HOOMD.

Note: to visualize the live demos, you need to have VMD 1.8.6 installed: http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/

\section sec_using_hoomd Using HOOMD

While HOOMD 0.6.0 is capable of running MD simulations, (as you can see in the benhcmarks and demos) 
in this release is not intended for most users to do so. Just open up benchmarks/polymer/polymer_bmark_gpu.hoomd
in a text editor and you will see why: it is complicated to setup a simulation run currently. HOOMD 0.7.0 will
improve on this with an user-friendly scripting system. Once it is complete, it will be documented here.

Sorry, but the benchmarks and demos are all that version 0.6.0 is meant to do. We are working hard
to get 0.7.0 done as soon as possible. Check out the <a href="http://trac2.assembla.com/hoomd/roadmap">roadmap</a>
page to monitor our progress.
