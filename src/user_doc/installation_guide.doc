\section sec_system_req System Requirements

Note: The CPU code in HOOMD is standards compliant C++ and should compile
on any architecture, contact the developers if you run into any problems
on a system not listed here. The rest of this page assumes you want to run
HOOMD on a GPU, thus limiting the options to those systems that
support CUDA http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home.html.

\section sec_hardware_req Hardware Requirements
 - \b CPU: Any x86 or x86_64 processor
 - \b RAM: At least 1GB is recommended, but HOOMD should run on systems with less.
 - \b GPU: Any CUDA capable card: http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home.html
 	- \b Recommended (in rough order of performance expected, see http://www.ameslab.gov/hoomd/benchmarks.html for actual
		performance numbers): 
		- GTX 280
		- GTX 260
		- Tesla 800 series
		- 8800 GTX
		- 8800 GTS 512MB
		- 8800 GT
	- \b NOTE! Some board manufacturers sell \em Factory \em Overclocked boards. 
	  These may work fine in games where a few bit errors just change the color
	  of an onscreen pixel slighly, but GPGPU applications are extremely 
	  sensitive to such errors. HOOMD and other CUDA apps are \b known \b to \b crash
	  on overclocked GPUs.
 - \b Motherboard: 16x PCIe slot for the graphics card. If you are installing the card
 	in a second slot, double check you motherboard manual first. Many motherboards
 	will decrease the slots to 8x with 2 cards installed. While HOOMD will still
 	run in such a configuration, it is not recommended for performance reasons.
 	
\section sec_software_user_req Software Requirements
 - \b OS: Linux, Mac OS X, Windows Vista, or Windows XP
 - \b Python installed: http://www.python.org
 - \b CUDA toolkit 1.1 installed: http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home.html
 	- Note: Vista currently requires a \b beta version of CUDA, download it here  http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showtopic=65067

\section sec_install_hoomd_windows Installing HOOMD in Windows XP

<b>Before you can install HOOMD</b>
 -# Install Python 2.5 using the installer at http://www.python.org/download/
 -# Install the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit version 1.1 using the installer at http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html
 	- Note: Vista users install version 2.0 beta 2
 -# Install the latest drivers for your GPU. Go to http://www.nvidia.com and select \b download \b drivers. Laptop users, see
 http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showtopic=58191
 	- Vista users must install the driver linked at http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html
 -# Download the HOOMD installer from http://www.ameslab.gov/hoomd
 -# Uninstall any previous version of HOOMD before continuing
 -# Double click on the installer and follow the on screen steps
 
HOOMD should now show up on your <b>Start menu</b> and the \a .hoomd file type 
is registered to execute the script when you double click on one.
The command \b hoomd, can also be run on the <b>command line</b> to start the HOOMD python interpreter.

The start menu includes links to benchmark scripts as well as several live demos.
In order to visualize the demos, you must have VMD 1.8.6 installed: http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/

\section sec_install_hoomd_linux Installing HOOMD in Linux

 -# Install the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit 1.1 for your linux distrubution: http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html
 -# Install the latest drivers for your GPU. Go to http://www.nvidia.com and select \b download \b drivers.
 -# Before you download HOOMD, check which python version you have by running 
 	\code
 python -V
 	\endcode
 	in a terminal.
 -# Download the matching HOOMD package from http://www.ameslab.gov/hoomd
 -# Extract it using your favorite tool or by running
 	\code
 tar -xvjf hoomd-0.6.1-Linux-x86_64-Python2.4.tar.bz2
 	\endcode
 	in a terminal (modify the filename to match the one you downloaded of course).
 -# Below, replace EXTRACTED_LOCATION with the location you extracted HOOMD to,
    i.e. /home/joaander/software/hoomd-0.6.1-Linux-x86_64
 -# Add EXTRACTED_LOCATION/bin to your $PATH. 
  See http://www.newlinuxuser.com/howto-add-a-directory-to-my-path-statementvariable/
  for instructions. You will probably need to log out and back in for the path setting 
  to take effect.

After installation is complete, you should be able to run 
\code
hoomd 
\endcode
in any terminal. You should see something like:
\code
Python 2.4.4 (#1, Nov  4 2007, 17:29:36)
[GCC 4.1.2 (Gentoo 4.1.2)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
\endcode
The python version is printed because HOOMD is really just a python
module. Job scripts are python scripts, and the hoomd executable is just a front end 
to python. Writing a job script for HOOMD requires only a \b minimum of python language
knowledge: anyone who can use the command shell should have no trouble learning to write
scripts for HOOMD.

To test your installation further, yo can execute packaged \b benchmarks and <b>live demos</b>. 
You will find them in EXTRACTED_LOCATION/share/hoomd
For example, to run the polymer benchmark on the GPU:
\code
cd EXTRACTED_LOCATION/share/hoomd/benchmarks/polymer
./polymer_bmark.hoomd --mode=gpu
\endcode

Note: to visualize the live demos, you need to have VMD 1.8.6 installed: http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/
