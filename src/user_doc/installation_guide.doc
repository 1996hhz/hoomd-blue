\section sec_system_req System Requirements for executing HOOMD on a GPU
 - \b OS: Linux, Mac OS X, Windows Vista, or Windows XP
 	- \b Note: Mac OS X versions older than 10.5.4 are not supported
 - \b CPU: Any x86 or x86_64 processor
 - \b RAM: At least 1GB is recommended
 - \b GPU: Any CUDA capable card: http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home.html
 	- \b Recommended (listed here in the rough order of performance expected, see http://www.ameslab.gov/hoomd/benchmarks.html for actual performance numbers): 
		- GTX 285/295 (fastest)
		- GTX 280
		- Tesla 10 series
		- GTX 260
		- Tesla 800 series
		- 8800 GTX
		- 8800 GTS 512MB
		- 8800 GT
	- \b NOTE! Some board manufacturers sell \em Factory \em Over-clocked boards. 
	  These may work fine in games where a few bit errors just change the color
	  of an onscreen pixel slightly, but GPGPU applications are extremely 
	  sensitive to such errors. HOOMD and other CUDA apps are \b known \b to \b crash
	  on over-clocked GPUs.
 - \b Motherboard: 16x PCIe slot for the graphics card. 
 	- If you are installing the card
 		in a second slot, double check you motherboard manual first. Many motherboards
 		will decrease the slots to 8x with 2 cards installed. While HOOMD will still
 		run in such a configuration, it is not recommended for performance reasons.
 - \b Power supply: Check with the GPU manufacturer for the power supply requirements for your GPU.
 	If you have a store-bought system, its power supply is likely inadequate and will require upgrading.

\section sec_install_hoomd_windows Installing HOOMD in Windows

 -# Download the HOOMD installer from http://www.ameslab.gov/hoomd
 -# Install Python 2.5 using the installer at http://www.python.org/download/
 -# Install the corresponding drivers for your GPU. Go to http://www.nvidia.com and select \b download \b drivers.
 	- Note: The HOOMD download page lists compatible driver version(s).
 	- Laptop users, see<br>
	http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showtopic=58191
 -# Uninstall any previous version of HOOMD before continuing
 -# Double click on the HOOMD installer and follow the on screen steps
 
HOOMD should now show up on your <b>Start menu</b> and the \a .hoomd file type 
is registered to execute the script when you double click on one.
The command \b hoomd can also be run on the <b>command line</b> to start the HOOMD python interpreter.

The start menu includes links to benchmark scripts for checking the performance of your setup as well
as some live demos that are fun to watch. In order to visualize the demos, you must have VMD 1.8.6 
installed: http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/

Check out the \ref page_quick_start to learn how to use HOOMD.

\section sec_install_hoomd_linux Installing HOOMD in Linux

 -# Before you download HOOMD, check which python version you have by running 
 	\code
 python -V
 	\endcode
 	in a terminal.
 -# Download the matching HOOMD package from http://www.ameslab.gov/hoomd
 -# Install the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit using the installer from http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html
 	- Note: Make sure you install the toolkit version listed on the HOOMD download page.
	- Add /usr/local/cuda/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH (can be modified similar to PATH below)
 -# Install the corresponding drivers for your GPU. Go to http://www.nvidia.com and select \b download \b drivers.
 	- Note: The drivers must match with the CUDA toolkit you installed. The HOOMD download page lists
 		compatible driver version(s). 
 -# Extract the HOOMD package using your favorite tool or by running
 	\code
 tar -xvjpf hoomd-0.7.1-Linux-x86_64-Python2.5.tar.bz2
 	\endcode
 	in a terminal (modify the filename to match the one you downloaded of course).
	- Note: If you extract this package in /opt as root, it will be installed in a system directory for
		any user on the system to run. If you prefer/need to have your own local copy, just extract
		to your home directory.
 -# Below, replace EXTRACTED_LOCATION with the location you extracted HOOMD to,
    i.e. /home/joaander/software/hoomd-0.7.1-Linux-x86_64-Python2.5
 -# Add EXTRACTED_LOCATION/bin to your $PATH. 
  See http://www.newlinuxuser.com/howto-add-a-directory-to-my-path-statementvariable/
  for instructions. You will probably need to log out and back in for the path setting 
  to take effect.

After installation is complete, run 
\code
hoomd 
\endcode
in any terminal. You should see something like this:
\code
Python 2.4.4 (#1, Nov  4 2007, 17:29:36)
[GCC 4.1.2 (Gentoo 4.1.2)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
\endcode
Press CTRL-D to exit.

To test your installation further, you can execute benchmark scripts th check the performance of your setup
or run some live demos that are fun to watch. You will find them in EXTRACTED_LOCATION/share/hoomd
For example, to run the polymer benchmark on the GPU:
\code
cd EXTRACTED_LOCATION/share/hoomd/benchmarks/
./polymer_bmark.hoomd --mode=gpu
\endcode

Note: to visualize the live demos, you need to have VMD 1.8.6 installed: http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/
