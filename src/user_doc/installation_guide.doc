\section sec_system_req System Requirements (to run on a GPU)
 - \b OS: Linux, Mac OS X, Windows Vista, or Windows XP
 - \b CPU: Any x86 or x86_64 processor
 - \b RAM: At least 1GB is recommended
 - \b GPU: Any CUDA capable card: http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home.html
 	- \b Recommended (listed here in the rough order of performance expected, see http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/benchmarks.html for actual performance numbers): 
		- GTX 285/295 (fastest)
		- GTX 280
		- Tesla 10 series
		- GTX 275
		- GTX 260
		- GTS 250
		
 - \b Motherboard: 16x PCIe slot for the graphics card. 
 - \b Power supply: Check with the GPU manufacturer for the power supply requirements for your GPU.
 	If you have a store-bought desktop system, its power supply is likely inadequate and will require upgrading.

\section sec_install_hoomd_windows Installing HOOMD-blue in Windows

 -# Download the HOOMD-blue installer from http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/
 -# Install Python 2.5.x using the installer at http://www.python.org/download/
 -# Install the latest drivers for your GPU from http://www.nvidia.com
 -# Uninstall any previous version of HOOMD/HOOMD-blue before continuing
 -# Double click on the HOOMD-blue installer and follow the on screen steps
 
HOOMD-blue should now show up on your <b>Start menu</b> and the \a .hoomd file type 
is registered to execute the script when you double-click on one.
The command \b hoomd can also be run on the <b>command line</b> to start the HOOMD-blue python interpreter.

The start menu also includes links to the standard benchmark scripts.

Check out the \ref page_quick_start to learn how to use hoomd.

\section sec_install_hoomd_linux Installing HOOMD-blue in Linux

 -# Before you download HOOMD-blue, check which python version you have by running 
 	\code
 python -V
 	\endcode
 	in a terminal.
 -# Download the matching HOOMD-blue package from http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/
 -# Install the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit using the installer from http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html
    - Note: Make sure you install the toolkit version listed on the HOOMD-blue download page.
    - Add /usr/local/cuda/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH (can be modified similar to PATH below)
 -# Install the latest drivers for your GPU from http://www.nvidia.com
 -# Extract the HOOMD-blue package using your favorite tool or by running
 	\code
 tar -xvjpf hoomd-0.7.1-Linux-x86_64-Python2.5.tar.bz2
 	\endcode
 	in a terminal (modify the filename to match the one you downloaded of course).
	- Note: If you extract this package in /opt as root, it will be installed in a system directory for
		any user on the system to run. If you need to have your own local copy, just extract
		to your home directory.
 -# Below, replace EXTRACTED_LOCATION with the location you extracted HOOMD-blue to,
    i.e. /home/joaander/software/hoomd-0.8.2-Linux-x86_64-Python2.5
 -# Add EXTRACTED_LOCATION/bin to your $PATH.
  See http://www.newlinuxuser.com/howto-add-a-directory-to-my-path-statementvariable/
  for instructions. You will probably need to log out and back in for the path setting 
  to take effect.

After installation is complete, run 
\code
hoomd 
\endcode
in any terminal. You should see something like this:
\code
Python 2.4.4 (#1, Nov  4 2007, 17:29:36)
[GCC 4.1.2 (Gentoo 4.1.2)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
\endcode
Press CTRL-D to exit.

To test your installation further, you can execute the standard benchmark scripts.
You will find them in EXTRACTED_LOCATION/share/hoomd. For example, to run the polymer benchmark on the GPU:
\code
cd EXTRACTED_LOCATION/share/hoomd/benchmarks/
./polymer_bmark.hoomd --mode=gpu
\endcode

Check out the \ref page_quick_start to learn how to use hoomd.

 	- \b Note: Make sure you install the toolkit version listed on the HOOMD-blue download page.
	- \b Note: Make sure to select the \em Customize button and ensure that \em CUDAKext is selected.
	- Add /usr/local/cuda/lib to DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (see instructions for PATH below)
 -# Make sure that the Apple \b Software \b Update tool has installed all updates related to the video drivers. 
 -# Extract the HOOMD-blue package using your favorite tool or by running
 	\code
 tar -xvjpf hoomd-0.8.0-Darwin-i386-Python2.5.tar.bz2
