/*! \page page_xml_file_format XML File Format

Both \link hoomd_script.init.read_xml init.read_xml\endlink and \link hoomd_script.dump.xml dump.xml\endlink
work with the same XML file format for specifying the system of particles. The format requires a minimal 
amount of meta-information in an easy to understand human-readable format. One of the key advantages of using 
XML is that it is also easily machine readable and commonly used, so many parsers exist for it.

The basic outline of a HOOMD xml file looks like this
\code
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<hoomd_xml>
<configuration time_step="0">
	<!-- data nodes go here --!>
</configuration>
</hoomd_xml>
\endcode
